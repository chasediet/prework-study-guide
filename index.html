        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is used for task management within coding</li>
          <li>You have git locally and then git remotely</li>
          <li>
            Git status- helps you check which branch you are in and shows any
            files that have been modified or changed in the working directory,
            staged for your next commit
          </li>
          <li>
            Git checkout- switches you to another branch and makes it your
            working directory?
          </li>
          <li>
            git pull fetches and merges any commits from the tracking remote
            branch
          </li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>
            git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it
          </li>
          <li>
            What the different letter abbreviations mean
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>-b:</strong> Example:
                <strong>git branch -b &lt;new_branch&gt;</strong> Used to create
                a new branch and then switch to it. So basically without
                <strong>-b</strong> you would have to do
                <strong>git branch &lt;new_branch&gt; </strong> and then
                <strong>git checkout &lt;new_branch&gt;</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>-A:</strong> Example: <strong>git add -A:</strong> This
                will stage all modified and deleted files, as well as any new
                files that have been added to the working tree. Basically stages
                all changes, including new modified and deleted files. This
                command will stage all changes in the currenty directory and its
                subdirectories.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>-m:</strong> Example:
                <strong
                  >git commit -m &quotadded code to HTML file&quot:</strong
                >
                The <strong>&quotm&quot</strong> option is used to specify a
                commit message when committing changes to the repository. It
                allows you to specify the commit message direcly on the command
                line instead of opening an editor to write the message.
